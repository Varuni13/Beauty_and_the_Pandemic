# Beauty_and_the_Pandemic
This project addresses the Covid-19 pandemic's impact on the beauty industry by revamping a startup's website with a virtual try-on application. Users can upload a photo, select their skin tone and undertone, and receive personalized makeup recommendations from five products, enhancing engagement and facilitating purchases.
